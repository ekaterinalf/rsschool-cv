## About Me
In the past, I worked in retail for 8 years, working in purchasing, assortment management and analytics. Promoted to Product Manager. The work was not fun, and the pandemic and layoffs helped me move on and change my profession to a more modern and progressive one. I started by learning layout and JavaScript on my own with the help of HTML Academy and various open sources. Then she trained at Elbrus Coding Bootcamp.
